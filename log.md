# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to code part of [Bikcraft Project](https://github.com/tiagosoares94/bikcraft/commits/master). But this is an online course, i'll follow the rules and make another projects, a real one.
I decided to continue my progress at FreeCodeCamp, i'm finishing the jQuery part and i'll start to make the Tribute Page soon.

**Thoughts:** This is my first day, I'm excited and happy for this challenge.
